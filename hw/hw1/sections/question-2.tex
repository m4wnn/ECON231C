%%%%% PROBLEM STATEMENT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{myanswerbox}
While proving the Hoeffding inequality, we said that two probabilities,
\[ P\left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i - \mu \geq t \right) \]
and
\[ P\left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i - \mu \leq -t \right), \]
can be bounded in the same way and did the derivation only for the former probability. Show that the latter probability is indeed bounded by the same quantity.
