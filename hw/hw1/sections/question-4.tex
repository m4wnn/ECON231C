%%%%% PROBLEM STATEMENT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{myanswerbox}
While proving the maximal inequality, i.e., a bound on
\[ P\left(\max_{1 \leq j \leq p} \left| \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{ij} - \mu_j \right| \geq t \right), \]
we applied the union bound followed by the Hoeffding inequality. Show what happens if we replace the Hoeffding inequality by the Chebyshev inequality.
