\begin{myanswerbox}
(Tricky) While proving the Hoeffding inequality, we have used the following bound:
\[ P(X > \delta) \leq \frac{E[e^{\lambda X}]}{e^{\lambda \delta}}, \quad \lambda > 0. \]
An alternative could be
\[ P(X > \delta) \leq \frac{E[|X|^k]}{\delta^k}, \quad k \geq 0. \]
Show that if \( X \geq 0 \) a.s., then
\[ \inf_{k=0,1,2,\ldots} \frac{E[|X|^k]}{\delta^k} \leq \inf_{\lambda>0} \frac{E[e^{\lambda X}]}{e^{\lambda \delta}}. \]
